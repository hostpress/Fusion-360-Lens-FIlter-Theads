# Fusion-360-Lens-FIlter-Theads
List of common camera lens front filter metric threads missing from Autodesk Fusion 360
Usually they have either 0.75mm pitch or 1.0mm pitch threads.

Prototyping only. Use at own risk.

I am not sure what the Pitch and Location Tolerances numbers are for Filter Threads they come in 6g 6H 4g6g and many many others. I used the most standard ones https://www.accu.co.uk/en/p/134-iso-metric-thread-tolerances or https://www.engineersedge.com/hardware/metric-external-thread-sizes1.htm


This file is meant for an example or a starter file. I could be wrong so check first you may get cross threading or major camera lens thread damage if you use this file for metal machining.  I am using 3d PLA filament to print these so the threads are soft and don't damage anything.

I have zero knowledge and am a beginner, talk to a proper local machinist. Although they will most likely not deal with such small items unfortunately.


Based on thread calculator from https://amesweb.info/Screws/metric-thread-dimensions-calculator.aspx
or http://theoreticalmachinist.com/Threads-MetricMProfile.aspx

I cross checked with both calcualtors and they both give different tolerances for the exact same input and both have values that are different to ones found already in Fusion 360 for same sizes.
